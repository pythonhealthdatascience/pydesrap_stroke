# Log

## Set-up

Created template from Python DES RAP Template v1.2.0

Created `docs/log.md` to keep a record of all changes necessary to adapt the template.

Used the template at the end of a README to make a first draft README.

Emptied `docs/heather_2025.md` and `docs/nhs_rap.md`. Deleted `docs/hsma_changes.md`.

Used [llm_simpy/notebooks/03_stroke/00_stress/](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/llm_simpy/tree/main/notebooks/03_stroke/00_stress) to fill out `docs/stress_des.md`.

> **Reflections:**
> 
> * Could encourage / suggestion Allyon 2021 [Keeping modelling notebooks with TRACE: Good for you and good for environmental research and management support](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815220309890).
> * Template README could have space for orcid.
> * Should template README just be a seperate file? But then would have to rename, so maybe, fine as is.
> * Empty versions of docs/ would have been handy.
