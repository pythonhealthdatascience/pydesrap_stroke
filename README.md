## üìå¬†¬†Introduction

This repository provides a template for building discrete-event simulation (DES) models in Python.

‚ôªÔ∏è **Reproducible:** This template is designed to function as a RAP. It adheres to reproducibility recommendations from:

* Recommendations from [Heather et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.13137) "*On the reproducibility of discrete-event simulation studies in health research: an empirical study using open models*" (`docs/heather_2025.md`).
* The ["Levels of RAP" framework](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/levels_of_RAP/) from the NHS RAP Community of Practice (`docs/nhs_rap.md`).

üòä **Simple:** Easy-to-follow code structure using [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Implements a simple M/M/s queueing model in which patients arrive, wait to see a nurse, have a consultation with the nurse and then leave. Follows a modular structure: uses object-oriented programming, with the simulation implemented through classes.

üß± **Package structure:** In Python, a package can simply be defined as a directory with an `__init__.py` file in it. In this repository, the scripts for model (within `simulation/`) are treated as a little local package. This keeps the code model code isolated from our experiments and analysis. It is installed as an editable (`-e`) local import - with `-e` meaning it will update with changes to the local files in `simulation/`. As it is installed in our environment, it can then easily be used anywhere else in the directory - here, in `notebooks/` and `tests/` - without needing any additional code (e.g. no need to modify `sys.path`, or have additional `__init__.py` files).

üöÄ **Extendable:** This template is partly adapted from Sammi Rosser and Dan Chalk (2024) ["HSMA - the little book of DES"](https://github.com/hsma-programme/hsma6_des_book). The book includes additional advanced features that can be used to extend the model in this template, including:

* Multiple activities
* Branching paths
* Priority-based queueing
* Reneging, blaking and jockeying
* Variable arrival rates
* Appointment booking

For clarity, changes from the DES book in this template are explained in `docs/hsma_changes.md`.

‚ú® **Style:** The coding style is based on the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). Linting is implemented using `pylint` (with `nbqa` to enable it to run on jupyter notebooks).

<br>

## üßê What are we modelling?

A **simulation** is a computer model that mimics a real-world system. It allows us to test different scenarios and see how the system behaves. One of the most common simulation types in healthcare is **DES**.

In DES models, time progresses only when **specific events** happen (e.g., a patient arriving or finishing treatment). Unlike a continuous system where time flows smoothly, DES jumps forward in steps between events. For example, when people (or tasks) arrive, wait for service, get served, and then leave.

*Simple model animation created using web app developed by Sammi Rosser (2024) available at https://github.com/hsma-programme/Teaching_DES_Concepts_Streamlit and shared under an MIT Licence.*

One simple example of a DES model is the **M/M/s queueing model**, which is implemented in this template. In a DES model, we use well-known **statistical distributions** to describe the behaviour of real-world processes. In an M/M/s model we use:

* **Poisson distribution** to model patient arrivals - and so, equivalently, use an **exponential distribution** to model the inter-arrival times (time from one arrival to the next)
* **Exponential distribution** to model server times.

These can be referred to as Markovian assumptions (hence "M/M"), and "s" refers to the number of parallel servers available.

For this M/M/s model, you only need three inputs:

1. **Average arrival rate**: How often people typically arrive (e.g. patient arriving to clinic).
2. **Average service duration**: How long it takes to serve one person (e.g. doctor consultation time).
3. **Number of servers**: How many service points are available (e.g. number of doctors).

This model could be applied to a range of contexts, including:

| Queue | Server/Resource |
| - | - |
| Patients in a waiting room | Doctor's consultation
| Patients waiting for an ICU bed | Available ICU beds |
| Prescriptions waiting to be processed | Pharmacists preparing and dispensing medications |

## üõ†Ô∏è Using this template

### Step 1: Create a new repository

1. Click on <kbd>Use this template</kbd>.
2. Provide a name and description for your new project repository.
3. Clone the repository locally: 

```
git clone https://github.com/username/repo
cd repo
```

### Step 2: Set-up the development environment

Use the provided `environment.yaml` file to set up a reproducible Python environment with `conda`:

```
conda env create --file environment.yaml
conda activate
```

The provided environment.yaml file is a snapshot of the environment used when creating the template, including specific package versions. You can update this file if necessary, but be sure to test that everything continues to work as expected after any updates. Also note that some dependencies are not required for modelling, but instead served other purposes, like running `.ipynb` files and linting.

As an alternative, a `requirements.txt` file is provided which can be used to set up the environment with `virtualenv`. This is used by GitHub actions, which run much faster with a virtual environment than a conda environment. However, we recommend locally installing the environment using conda, as it will also manage the Python version for you. If using `virtualenv`, it won't fetch a specific version of Python - so please note the version listed in `environment.yaml`.

### Step 3: Explore and modify

üîé Choose your desired licence (e.g. <https://choosealicense.com/>). If keeping an MIT licence, just modify the copyright holder in `LICENSE`.

üîé Review the example DES implementation in `simulation` and `notebooks`. Modify and extend the code as needed for your specific use case.

üîé Check you still fulfil the criteria in `docs/nhs_rap.md` and `docs/heather_2025.md`.

üîé Adapt the template `README` provided at the end of this file.

üîé Create your own `CITATION.cff` file using [cff-init](https://citation-file-format.github.io/cff-initializer-javascript/#/).

üîé Replace `pyproject.toml` and entries in the current `CHANGELOG.md` with your own versions, and create GitHub releases.

üîé Archive your repository (e.g. [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)).

üîé Complete the Strengthening The Reporting of Empirical Simulation Studies (STRESS) checklist (`stress_des.md`) and use this to support writing publication/report, and attach as an appendice to report.

üìî **Notebooks**

Several notebooks are provided which provide examples running the models, choosing parameters, and explaining how things work. If you wish to execute all notebooks from the command line, you can use the providing bash script by running:

```
bash run_notebooks.sh
```

üîé **Tests**

To run tests, ensure environment is active and located in main directory (i.e. parent of `tests/`) and then run the following command. The tests may take around one minute to run. As they run, you will see '.' if the test passes and 'F' if it fails (e.g. `tests/test_backtest.py ..F..`). When it finishes, you will see the final result (e.g. `==== 1 failed, 4 passed in 51s ====`)

```
pytest
```

To run tests in parallel -

```
pytest -n auto
```

To run a specific test:

```
pytest tests/testfile.py -k 'testname'
```

The repository contains a GitHub action `tests.yaml` which will automatically run tests with new commits to GitHub. This is continuous integration, helping to catch bugs early and keep the code stable. It will run the tests on three operating systems: Ubuntu, Windows and Mac.

If you have changed the model behaviour, you may wish to amend, remove or write new tests.

üîé **Linting**

You can lint the `.py` files by running:

```
pylint simulation/model.py
```

You can lint the `.ipynb` by adding `nbqa` to the start of the command - e.g.:

```
nbqa pylint notebooks/analysis.ipynb
```

A bash script has been provided which can be used to lint all files in succession by running:

```
bash lint.sh
```

<br>

## ‚ùì How does the model work?

This section describes the purposes of each class in the simulation.

**Model Run Process:**

1. **Set Parameters:** Create a `Param` instance with desired model parameters.
2. **Initialise Model:** Instantiate `Model` using the parameters. During setup, `Model` creates `Exponential` instances for each distribution.
3. **Run Simulation:** Call `model.run()` to execute the simulation within the SimPy environment, running two processes:

    * `generate_patient_arrivals()` to handle patient creation, then sending them on to `attend_clinic()`.
    * `interval_audit()` to record utilisation and wait times at specified intervals during the simulation.

**Runner Class Usage:**

Having set up `experiment = Runner()`...

* **Single Run:** Use `experiment.run_single()` to execute a single model run.
* **Multiple Runs:** Use `experiment.run_reps()` to perform multiple replications of the model.

## ‚è∞ Run time and machine specification

The overall run time will vary depending on how the template model is used. The run times for the files in `notebooks/`:

* `analysis.ipynb` - 37s
* `choosing_cores.ipynb` - 25s
* `choosing_replications.ipynb` - 11s
* `choosing_warmup.ipynb` - 3s
* `generate_exp_results.ipynb` - 2s
* `logs.ipynb` - 0s
* `time_weighted_averages.ipynb` - 0s

<!--TODO: Update run times -->
